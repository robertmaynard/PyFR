/*
 * The vertex and solution arrays are three dimensional having a
 * format of [nb][X][na] where X = 3 for the vertex array (x, y, z)
 * and X = 5 for the solution array (rho, rhou, rhov, rhow, E).  The
 * total number of nodes is na*nb.
 *
 * The solution array is a device pointer.  To make things more
 * interesting it is also padded.  The distance between [i][j][k] and
 * [i + 1][j][k] is ldim elements.  The distance between [i][j][k] and
 * [i][j + 1][k] is lsdim elements.  Fun for the entire family!
 *
 * The total number of linear VTK elements is given by nel.  The type
 * of the i'th VTK element is given by type[i].  The offset of its node
 * numbers in the connectivity array is given by off[i] with the number
 * of nodes being determined by the type.  The node number
 * associated with the first vertex is therefore con[off[i]].  Care
 * must be taken when looking up this node in vert/soln due to their
 * three dimensional structure.
